This is a Fork from Zypr's perfectrootserver
It's for my personal use and sometimes there can appear bugs!


#Short instructions:

[Get the latest release](https://github.com/shoujii/perfectrootserver/releases/latest "Latest Release"):
```
wget -O ~/perfectrootserver.tar.gz https://github.com/shoujii/perfectrootserver/archive/0.1.4.tar.gz
```

Extract:
```
tar -xzf ~/perfectrootserver.tar.gz -C ~/ --strip-components=1
```

Edit settings to your needs:
```
nano ~/userconfig.cfg
```

Start the installation script:
```
bash ~/install.sh
```

Follow the instructions! 

> At the end of the installation, the script creates a file with all the credentials. The wizard helps you set up your system and checks if the settings are correct.
